# Agriculture-productivity-analysis
I collected raw agricultural data related to crop production and water usage. The dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Python libraries to uncover meaningful insights. The project applies data analysis and visualization techniques to highlight trends, correlations, and productivity patterns among different crops.
